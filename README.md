# PrivateUOServerGuide
This is a guide for people looking to test code in Ultima Online. It will be published online when I finish the website. I am writing it in C# and ASP.NET. 

The guide is designed to walk you through the steps and setup necessary to launch a local server for your ultima online adventures. It allows you to change the code and see it run in real time. In the future I may develop a stand alone launcher that will replace the current steps.

# When will it be live?
I worked on this page as a small assignment for school, so when I finish updating the code for it I will publish it live. It is mainly meant to be a learning experience for me 
on web development, but hopefully it will be able to help someone interested in testing code and learning about this great game.

# Why ASP.NET
It probably doesn't need to be an ASP.NET site as it's pretty much static but I wanted to practice routing and the like so I built it like that
