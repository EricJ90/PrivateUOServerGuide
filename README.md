# PrivateUOServerGuide
This is a guide for people looking to test code in Ultima Online. It will be published online when I finish the website. I am writing it in C# and ASP.NET.

# When will it be live?
I worked on this page as a small assignment for school, so when I finish updating the code for it I will publish it live. It is mainly meant to be a learning experience for me 
on web development, but hopefully it will be able to help someone interested in testing code and learning about this great game.
